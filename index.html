	<!-- this is my first html page and i am creating simple webpage -->
	<p> I personally hope that after the end of this semester I will be creating various types of websites, css styles etc. not only that but I will be having information about html structure, codes, tags etc. HTML is mandatory for any web programming language, and is extremely useful for any web design. Teaching seems to be fun as I already have learned this course back in India. We have easy going person teaching us html Mr. Jason Carman. Besides this we will learn how to work In group which would be like more beneficial in future because we will be working in groups.</p>

	<pre> The way we're attached to our phones these days, they buzz and twitch in our pockets, and we have to look and see if it was a text, a voicemail, or an e-mail. We're almost like lab rats. I tried to eschew the whole cell phone theory until I had kids; then, I had to be reachable at all times.- eddie vedder</pre>
